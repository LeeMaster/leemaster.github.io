# LinkedList characters and Arrays

To find the releation of the List and Array in action 

## LinkedList 

As we know that the linked list will use the struct -- node to linke the all elementss in a stright line in logic ,but the all elements node will be arrange in different memeory space . This structure will be used to dynamical expand and don't care the memeory space , but there are also some defects to use this struture to manage the elements , first is the search time and the next is the insert time at specific position , they all O(n).

## Arrays 

This structure will alloc the space at the start time , and the search time is O(1) and the insert time is alse O(n) not inserting at first or last.

# How to use the Hash method

We have found t

# optimize the Search and insertion
